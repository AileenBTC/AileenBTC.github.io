		<li> Photography</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I was gifted a camera by my parents in Chirstmas of 2015. I was shocked as being given this gift 
		because it was something that I would never expect to be given to me, ever since then I enjoy to take pictres on my 
		free time and build up a photography profolio.</p>

	        <li> Drawing </li>
		</ul>
		<p>I enjoy drawing but I don't draw as much as I use to due to the fact that it's time consuming,
		For this year I would like to draw more and see the progression throughout the years.</p>

                <li> Cooking </li>
		</ul>
		<p>Cooking is something that I do frequently.
		If there's something I want to cook my mom has me jot down the ingredients and we'll buy the ingrients and 
		start cooking right away. The only thing about cooking something new is i'm hesitant 
		about the food not tasting good but in the end it does end up tasting good.</p>

        <h2>Family </h2>
		
	<p>There is 5 family members, out of my two other siblings
	I am the middle child/2nd oldest. 
	I have an older brother who is in highschool right now and
	a younger sister who is in elemantary school.
	During friday's or weekends me and my family like to help baby sit my two cousins, 
	although we enjoy babysitting them it can be a handful
	because they have so much energy it's hard to keep them calm. </p>
