		<h2>Highschool:</h2>
		</ul>
                <p> The high school that I would like to attend to is McBride.
		I put Mcbride as my first choice because this high school is known for their engineering and medical program which I am interested in thus being my first choice. I feel like going to McBride will give more insight about these in particular knowing that there is many opportunity opened.</p>

               <li> Engineer</li>
	       <p>For my career interest I want to do something in the arts. Growing up I always enjoyed art, getting older my love for art has increased. Out of the four options that is listed the two that is most complex for me to improve on is Photography and Digital/graphic art. Receiving criticism is not a problem because it shows what I need to focus more in order to perfect the subject.</p>
