		<p>Wings is there 2nd full lenghth album. I would say that this album is very different from their other albums because 
		each members has their own solo song which broadcasts there individual talents of rapping and singing. This album is also the 
		start to a new series since the Most beautiful Moments in Life Trilogy had ended in 2016 with the album Young Forever.</p>
