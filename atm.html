		<li>6th Grade ATM: Typing-Microsoft Word-Microsoft Powerpoint-Microsoft Excel-</li>
		</ul>
                 <p>6th grade ATM went by very fast. We learned how to type properly, 
		how to make a Microsoft document,Powerpoints, excel. Learning how to use office programs really 
		 does help because it's something that we're always be using in school and even at our jobs.
		 Since we know how to use office programs it makes it easier to get project, assignments done 
		 efficiently with the look of it having done professionally.</p>

		<p>personally this was my favorite year of ATM because we got to learn about photoshop, illustrator, floorplanner and sketchup. 
		At first I was skeptical about using these programs because I didn't think I'd use it well or make something decent 
		but when both Ms.Milton and Ms. McClure taught us how to use the programs properly I began to have confidence in my projects and grew a strong likeing using these programs.
		The thing about using these programs is if you want to master them you have to practice and practice until your satisfied with your own skills. </p>

                <li>8th Grade ATM: Garage Band-Coding HTML and CSS-Filming Basics</li> 
		</ul>
                <p>This year we learned about garageband,html/css, and visual studio code. Out of all the programs we had learned these I found visual studio code hard to use 
	         because if you do not type in the right code then your website will not work properly, that is the only problem that I have been struggling in so far.</p>

		<li> My opinion on ATM</li>
		</ul>
		<p>ATM has been an feeling of expirences. As entering 6th grade ATM I did not know what to expect of myself, I did not
	          know if I would be good meaning if I can develope the basic skill of using office programs along with typing speed. Learning how to type 
		  properly, how to make a microsoft documet,powerpoint,excel really did teach me how to make things properly and understand the basic statistics 
		  although many incoming ATM students might be scared or nervous entering the begining of 6th grade ATM I can gauranteed that they will enjoy it. Practing is the 
		   key to your goal. I feel like 7th grade ATM was a favorite year of ATM for me and other students because we got to learn how to use all sorts of designing programs. 
		   7th grade year of ATM express and showed the creative side to all 7th grade ATM students. Overall ATM is a good program that teaches the students the
		   true meaning of ATM and that it is more then what we know. Student's should take the opportunity to join the ATM  program because Ms. Milton and Ms. McClure will 
		   teach them all they need to know to help them throughout middle school, highschool, college, and even in their careers. With these skills it gives students an advantage to
		    showcase their individual skils.</p>
