                 <p>6th grade ATM went by very fast. We learned how to type properly, how to make a Microsoft document,Powerpoints, excel. Learning how to use office programs really does help because it's something that we're always be using in school and even at our jobs. Since we know how to use office programs it makes it easier to get project, assignments done efficiently with the look of it having done professionally.</p>

		<p>personally this was my favorite year of ATM because we got to learn about photoshop, illustrator, floorplanner and sketchup. At first I was skeptical about using these programs because I didn't think I'd use it well or make something decent but when both Ms.Milton and Ms. McClure taught us how to use the programs properly I began to have confidence in my projects and grew a strong likeing using these programs. The thing about using these programs is if you want to master them you have to practice and practice until your satisfied with your own skills. </P>

                <p>This year we learned about garageband,html/css, and visual studio code. Out of all the programs we had learned these I found visual studio code hard to use 
	         because if you do not type in the right code then your website will not work properly, that is the only problem that I have been struggling in so far.
	          in so far.</p>
